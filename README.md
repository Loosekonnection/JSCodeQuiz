## Pseudo Code

*   An HTML page needs creating with respective id's to hold the quiz and the dynamically created questions.
*   HTML Page Elements required would be:

    *   Navigation Section
    *   Banner Section
    *   Quiz Section
    *   Footer Section

*   The home page will need an brief explanation of the quiz.
*   There will need to be a Start Quiz button on the home page that dynamically via JS displays a series of questions with there respective answers.
*   Upon the selection of an answer the next question should be then displayed dynamically via JS.
*   If the question is correct then the player should be notified via a ```Correct!``` message.
*   If the question is incorrect the player should be notified via a ```Wrong!``` message.
*   Upon starting the quiz there will need to be a dynamically JS displayed countdown timer.
*   If all questions are not answered within the time frame, a game over message with the ability to retry will need to be displayed.
*   If all of the questions are answered within the time frame, the time left on the timer should be displayed as the players score.
*   The displayed score should be presented with an input field for the player to submit and record their initials or name along with the score.
*   The players initials/name and score will need to be stored in the local storage (as we are not using a database for this).
*   The site will need a High Scores page to display recorded high scores.
*   The High Scores page will need HTML page elements and id's for both static and dynamic content:

    *   Navigation Section
    *   Banner Section
    *   High Scores Section
    *   Footer Section

*   The High Scores page will also have two buttons:

    *   Go Back - to return the user to the home page. (although the NAV will contain a link to the homepage)
    *   Clear High Scores - Clear the local storage which will clear the High Scores table/page.
